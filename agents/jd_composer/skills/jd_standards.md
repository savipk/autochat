# Corporate Job Description Standards

## Purpose
This document defines the standards and guidelines for writing job descriptions
within the organization. All JDs must comply with these standards before posting.

## Structure Requirements

Every job description must contain exactly three sections:

### 1. Summary (150-250 words)
- Opening sentence: State the role title and team/division
- Second sentence: Describe the level and scope of responsibility
- Third sentence: Describe the primary focus area and impact
- Final sentence: High-level value proposition for the candidate

**Tone:** Confident, forward-looking, inclusive. Avoid jargon.

### 2. Responsibilities (6-8 bullet points)
- Start each bullet with a strong action verb
- First 2 bullets: Primary leadership/strategic responsibilities
- Next 2-3 bullets: Core technical/functional responsibilities
- Next 1-2 bullets: Collaboration and stakeholder management
- Final bullet: Growth/innovation responsibility

**Format:** Each bullet should be 1-2 lines maximum.

### 3. Qualifications (6-8 bullet points)
- First bullet: Years of overall experience required
- Second bullet: Years of specific domain/leadership experience
- Next 2-3 bullets: Technical skills and expertise
- Next 1-2 bullets: Soft skills and competencies
- Final bullet: Education requirements (use "preferred" not "required" for advanced degrees)

**Format:** Use ranges for years of experience (e.g., "8-10 years").

## Tone Guidelines
- Use inclusive language (avoid gendered pronouns)
- Prefer "you will" over "the candidate will"
- Be specific about impact, not just tasks
- Avoid superlatives ("world-class", "rockstar", "ninja")
- Use active voice throughout

## Level-Specific Guidelines

| Level | Team Size | Strategic Scope | Typical Experience |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Vice President | 3-8 | Team/project level | 6-10 years |
